# Snake
This is a smal implementation of the game Snake in python. All icon credits go to [Freepik](https://www.flaticon.com/authors/freepik).

## To run

This needs pygame, time, and random. pip install all of them to make sure. Then, just do `python snake.py` to play. Gameplay will start once you move the arrow keys for the first time.

## Problems

There is currently no way to grow longer. There is currently a way to collide with yourself and not die. The icons are really bad. The icons are too large for the current screen. The thing is in debug mode currently and thus has a small snake overlayed on all of them. The screen background color is rather terrible. 

Very much still a work in progress.
